                    import. When the demo data is finished importing, you will have many pages that contain widgets
                    configured in them. </p>

                    <li>As mentioned earlier, Livemesh SiteOrigin Widgets plugin is built on a powerful widget builder framework of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/so-widgets-bundle/"

                        options. If you need the plugin widgets auto activated by default, you can check the option
                            <strong>'Activate all plugin widgets'</strong> option. This will avoid you having to go to  <a href="<?php echo admin_url() . 'plugins.php?page=so-widgets-plugins'; ?>"

                <p>The strength of this plugin over many others is that this plugin lets you customize almost any piece of HTML
                    generated by an widget part of the plugin. You can move around or modify the output elements to suit your
                    needs - change HTML tags, change sequence of information (e.g., place image at the bottom of the post in a
                    grid), add new CSS classes of your own, add branding material, delete unneeded output element (e.g. remove
                    post meta information), modify information (e.g., truncate description or excerpt generated) etc. with the
                    help of templates and filters provided by the plugin. </p>
                <p>Following are the two ways to customize the output of an widget part of the plugin.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Filters</strong> are hooks that are provided at almost every customization opportunity that presents itself
                            as the widget renders the widgets by parsing the settings input by the user in the SiteOrigin editor. <strong>About 200+ filters have been
                                provided</strong> to help users customize almost any information output by the widgets of this plugin.</p>
                        <p>To locate the filters, the users are encouraged to have a look at the PHP code located in the <code>tpl/default.php</code> file of
                            the respective widget folder located in <code>includes/widgets/</code> folder.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://docs.presscustomizr.com/article/26-wordpress-actions-filters-and-hooks-a-guide-for-non-developers"

                    </li>
                    <li><p><strong>Templates</strong> let you modify the HTML generated by an widget by placing an appropriately
                            named PHP file in a folder named 'siteorigin-widgets' in your child theme (or parent theme).</p>
                        <p>Following are the names of the files that plugin looks for to customize the <i>respective</i> widget
                            rendering - <code> clients.php, carousel.php, heading.php, odometers.php, piecharts.php, posts-grid.php,
                                posts-carousel.php, pricing-table.php, services.php, stats-bars.php, team-members.php, testimonials.php,
                                testimonials-slider.php, accordion.php, button.php, faq.php, features.php, gallery.php, gallery-carousel.php,
                                icon-list.php, image-slider.php, posts-block.php, services-carousel.php, slider.php, tabs.php. </code></p>
                        <p>Once a particular template file is found in the theme folder, the corresponding widget rendering code is
                            replaced with that in the template PHP file. The template files are provided with <code>$settings</code> variable to
                            help read the widget settings and then display the output. The current output generated by the plugin widget can
                            be seen in the <code>tpl/default.php</code> file of the widgets folder located in <code>includes/widgets/</code> folder.<strong> In
                                most cases, it is recommended to copy over the rendering code from the <code>tpl/default.php</code> file to the template
                                file and modify the same to achieve the desired customization</strong>. A basic knowledge of PHP and HTML is all that is
                            required to customize an widget.</p>
                    <li><strong>Module Templates </strong>(<span class="pro-feature">Pro Feature</span>) are PHP files which can be placed in the <code>siteorigin-widgets/modules/</code> of
                        the child theme to customize the posts grid item information part of posts grid/block widgets output by module files located in <code>includes/blocks/modules/</code> folder
                        of the premium version of the plugin. The template files should be named as <code>module-1.php, module-2.php .... , module-12.php, module-13.php</code> to
                        match the corresponding files located in the <code>includes/blocks/modules</code> folder. Only HTML part of <code>render()</code> function needs to
                        be customized in the module template files. The users are recommended to copy over the rendering code part of this function to the corresponding
                        template file and then customize it to their needs. </code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The below sections provide help on each of the widgets built as part of Livemesh SiteOrigin Widgets

                <p>The heading widget is perhaps the most frequently used widget on a page since it displays a heading
                    at the top of a section.</p>
                <p>It comes in three styles – Style 1, Style 2 and Style 3 which allow variations of headings displayed
                    in various sections.</p>

                <p>The heading consists of the main heading text which is renders as one of the HTML heading tags on the
                    frontend. Additionally, a short text is displayed below the heading and some of the heading styles
                    allow you to input a subtitle which is usually displayed on top of the main heading title.</p>
                <p>You can choose to align the heading left, right or center with center being the default
                    alignment.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/products/livemesh-siteorigin-widgets-pro/" title="Livemesh SiteOrigin Widgets Pro" target="_blank">premium version</a> of the plugin allows selection of a custom font for the heading title. You may
                    choose one of 500+ custom fonts hosted in the Google Fonts library. By default, the heading font
                    used by the theme is used for main heading title.</p>

                <p>Many agencies, freelancers, corporates, products/apps require capturing the services provided by the
                    agency or the features of a product. The services widget is designed to help users capture these
                    services or features in a multi-column grid.</p>
                <p>The widget supports about 3 different styles (with 2 additional styles in <a href="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/products/livemesh-siteorigin-widgets-pro/" title="Livemesh SiteOrigin Widgets Pro" target="_blank">premium version</a> of the
                    plugin) and each of these styles can be customized further by choosing the type of icon desired to
                    represent the service – a font icon or an custom image icon. While the choice of font icons is huge
                    in number and perhaps sufficient for most common services, the icon images can help present the
                    unique nature of the services offered.</p>
                <p>Each of the service requires you to input a title for the service/feature and a short description of
                    the service offered or the product feature. Additionally, each service allows you to enter a font
                    icon or an icon image file to represent that service.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/products/livemesh-siteorigin-widgets-pro/" title="Livemesh SiteOrigin Widgets Pro" target="_blank">premium version</a> of the plugin allows you specify a custom font size, font color and and hover
                    color for the font icon along with providing two additional styles of services/features.</p>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-large" src="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/wp-content/uploads/plugin-doc/livemesh-widgets/services-widget-edit.png" alt="Services Widget Edit Window"></p>

                <p>Services widget supports the following options –</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Columns per row</strong> – Number of services to display per row of services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Icon Custom Size</strong> – If the icon chosen for services is icon font, you can
                        specify a custom size for the font icon in pixels.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Icon Custom Color</strong> – Specify a custom color for the font icon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Icon Custom Hover Color</strong> – Specify a custom hover color for the font icon.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This widget provides an easy way to capture the team members of your organization or an agency. The
                    details captured include team member name, position, a short description and the email plus social
                    profile of the individual team members.</p>
                <p>Two different styles are provided with more styles planned in the <a href="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/products/livemesh-siteorigin-widgets-pro/" title="Livemesh SiteOrigin Widgets Pro" target="_blank">premium version</a> of the plugin. Most
                    of the styles display the team members in a multi-column grid. The option to specify the number of
                    columns is provided that helps to control the number of team members displayed per row of the team
                    members.</p>

                <h3 id="statistics-widgets">Statistics Widgets<a class="back-to-top" href="#panel"> Back to top</a></h3>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-large" src="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/wp-content/uploads/plugin-doc/livemesh-widgets/statsbars-piecharts.png" alt="Statistics Widgets"></p>

                <p>The plugin features a number of widgets that help display statistical information in the form of
                    odometers, piecharts and stats bars. The <a href="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/products/livemesh-siteorigin-widgets-pro/" title="Livemesh SiteOrigin Widgets Pro" target="_blank">premium version</a> of the plugin also includes a countdown
                    widget that displays a countdown timer for planned events such as product launches or website going
                    live.</p>
                <p>Most of these widgets are designed to animate the display of the statistical information or numbers
                    when the users scroll down to the section containing the widget.</p>
                <p><strong>Odometers</strong></p>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-large" src="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/wp-content/uploads/plugin-doc/livemesh-widgets/odometers2.png" alt="Odometer Widget"></p>

                <p>This widget displays one or more animated odometer statistics in a multi-column grid. This number
                    statistic requires a start and an end value with a title and icon providing the information about
                    what the number represents – like a download number or number of products sold or customers
                    gained.</p>
                <p>The widget animates from the start value to the end value when the user scrolls down to the section.
                    You can control the number of such odometers displayed per row.</p>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-large" src="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/wp-content/uploads/plugin-doc/livemesh-widgets/odometers-edit.png" alt="Odometer Edit Window"></p>

                <p><strong>Stats Bars</strong></p>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-large" src="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/wp-content/uploads/plugin-doc/livemesh-widgets/statsbars-piecharts.png" alt="Stats Bar Piechart Widgets"></p>

                <p>Stats Bars capture percentage statistics like coverage area, skills gained, survey findings, usage
                    statistics etc. that typically require bar charts to represent them. Each statistical item requires
                    a percentage value, a title describing the number. The user can choose to display the bar charts in
                    multiple or single color with the help of color choice available with each value input.</p>
                <p>The widget animates from the zero to the percentage value set for the item when the user scrolls down
                    to the section containing the widget. The bars are placed one below the other horizontally.</p>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-large" src="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/wp-content/uploads/plugin-doc/livemesh-widgets/stats-bars-edit.png" alt="Stats Bar Widget Edit Window"></p>

                <p><strong>Piecharts</strong></p>
                <p>Piecharts provide an alternative way to display percentage stats. When the users scrolls down and the
                    chart becomes visible, the widget animates from zero to percentage value provided for the statistic.
                    A bar of user chosen color moves along a track to display the percentage information. An option to
                    specify the number of charts displayed per row is provided.</p>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-large" src="https://www.livemeshthemes.com/wp-content/uploads/plugin-doc/livemesh-widgets/piecharts-edit.png" alt="Piechart Widget Edit Window"></p>

                <p>This widget displays a countdown timer for an end date and time specified by the user. This is like a
                    clock ticking to signal the arrival of an event planned for a future date. The user just provides

                <p>Our tests indicate that the widgets work well with most themes that are well coded. You may need some
                    minor custom CSS with themes that hijack the styling for heading tags by using !important
                    keyword.</p>

                <p>The demo site is best recreated with a theme that supports a full width page template without
                    sidebars. The widgets can still be used in the widgetized sidebars of pages of default template.</p>

                <h3 id="faq-dark-version">How to enable the dark version for any widget?</h3>

                <p>In SiteOrigin page builder, add a row wrapper for the widget, edit row and check the option 'Dark
                    Background?' under 'Row Styles' &gt; Design.</p>

                <p>If not using a page builder, you can wrap the widget with a div of class 'lsow-dark-bg' to invoke
                    dark version. Make sure you set the appropriate dark background for the wrapper div.</p>
